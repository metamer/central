central
=======

Central location for unix/unix-like scripts

These include configuration files (dotfiles)

Run install to install files using symlinks. This is done instead of copying the files so that they are always linked to the repo. This way, a change to a config in an installed location will be affect the repo directly.

Please note that certain files such as the vim color files may have their own licenses.
